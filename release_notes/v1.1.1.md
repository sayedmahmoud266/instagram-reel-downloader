# Instagram Reel Downloader v1.1.1 - JSON File Parsing Fix

**Release Date:** September 16, 2025

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

This patch release fixes a critical issue with JSON file parsing in the `from-file` command that was causing all downloads to fail with "Invalid URL" errors.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### JSON File Parsing Issue
- **Problem**: JSON files were being parsed line-by-line instead of as proper JSON
- **Impact**: URLs included JSON formatting characters (brackets, quotes, commas)
- **Result**: All downloads failed with "Invalid URL" errors

### The Fix
- ✅ **Proper JSON parsing** using `JSON.parse()` for `.json` files
- ✅ **Clean URL extraction** without formatting characters
- ✅ **Smart file detection** based on file extension
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** maintained for text and CSV files

## 📋 Before vs After

### Before v1.1.1 (Broken)
```
❌ Error: Failed to download reel: Failed to get media info: Invalid URL
URLs being processed: [    "https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123",
```

### After v1.1.1 (Fixed)
```
📥 Downloading ABC123
✅ Successfully downloaded ABC123
URLs being processed: https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123
```

## 🎯 Affected Commands

This fix specifically improves:
- `from-file` command when using `.json` files
- JSON arrays containing Instagram URLs
- Mixed file format support (JSON, CSV, TXT)

## 📦 File Format Support

Now properly supports:

### JSON Files
```json
[
  "https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123",
  "https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEF456"
]
```

### Text Files (unchanged)
```
https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123
https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEF456
```

### CSV Files (unchanged)
```

```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

```bash
# Now works correctly with JSON files
instareels from-file links.json --skip-existing --save-metadata

# Still works with text files
instareels from-file links.txt --verbose

# CSV support maintained
instareels from-file links.csv
```

## 🔄 Migration

No migration needed - this is a transparent bug fix that maintains full backward compatibility.

## 🛠️ Technical Details
